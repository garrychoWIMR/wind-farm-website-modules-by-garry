				<p>The drive to develop renewable energies to reduce fossil fuel consumption has resulted in increasing efforts to harvest wind power as a source of renewable energy delivery.</p>
				<p> This need has resulted in the construction of multiple wind turbine clusters or “wind farms” in rural areas in Australia to generate power.</p>
		 	  <p>Wind power programs have been opposed by a number of communities, in part due to claims that wind farms pose a risk to health.</p>
		  	 <p> There is currently a lack of research exploring the effects of wind farms, in particular, inaudible levels of noise (called “infrasound”) on various health outcomes. Some individuals are more sensitive to noise than others, and we will be looking for these individuals to participate in this research study. This study will measure the impact of exposure to noise, including infrasound, on multiple dimensions of human health in individuals who report increased noise sensitivity.</p>
